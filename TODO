The following fields may be present in the data frame, but are not currently accounted for:
- O2 sensor voltage
- Fueling correction feedback
    (with >100% indicating an attempt to compensate for fueling being too lean,
     and <100% attempting to compensate for fueling being too rich)
- Ignition advance
- Ignition switch (?)
- Injector dead time
