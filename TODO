Find difference between F4 and FF commands
  (SP tool sends FF only when engine is running)

The following fields may be present in the data frame, but are not currently accounted for:
- O2 sensor voltage
- Fueling correction feedback
    (with >100% indicating an attempt to compensate for fueling being too lean,
     and <100% attempting to compensate for fueling being too rich)
- Ignition advance
- Ignition switch (?)
- Injector dead time
